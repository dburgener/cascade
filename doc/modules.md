# Modules
Modules are made up of domains, resources, traits (still in development) and
other modules. They are the building blocks for larger scale policy and are a
core component of a System. The user can declare multiple modules and create
systems from these modules. The user can then decide which of these individual
modules or systems to build (Building of individual modules and systems is not
yet supported. See ROADMAP.md for more information). Note that a module can also
be made virtual, in which case it cannot be built. The purpose of a virtual
module is to create other modules from it. Since virtual modules cannot have a
real instantiation, they are ineligible to be compile targets. The addition of
modules not only simplifies the process of policy building for users, but also
allows for customizability and scalability.
